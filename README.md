Missing Data can occur when no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit. Missing Data is a very big problem in real life scenario. Missing Data can also refer to as `NA`(Not Available) values in pandas. In DataFrame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was not collected or it never existed.
In this package, the missing values in a csv file are filled using the fillna function in pandas. For this the statistical model of mean is used.
